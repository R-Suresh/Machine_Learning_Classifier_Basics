# Machine_Learning_Classifier_Basics

This project compares and explicates different machine learning classifiers. The Wine dataset is used for this purpose.
* Input wine dataset (PCA based visualization) <br>![Svm Input](https://github.com/R-Suresh/SVM_Basics/blob/master/images/svm_input.png)

## Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* The file ```Wine Data Set SVM Classifier Visualization.ipynb``` gives a gentle intoduction into the world of SVMs with graphic illustrations of the dataset and decision boundry.

 ## Decision Trees
* The file ```Wine Data Set Decision Tree Classifier.ipynb``` shows a decision tree constructed for the wine dataset.
   * The model is trained directly and using grid search to illustrate the difference.

 ## KNN Classifier
* The file ```Wine Data Set Decision KNN Classifier Visualization.ipynb``` shows a KNN model constructed for the wine dataset.
